Option 1: Attach USB HDD Directly to Security Onion (Best Approach)
Steps to Achieve This:

Physically Connect the USB HDD to the ESXi host.

Step 1: Enable USB Passthrough in ESXi
Open VMware vSphere Client (or ESXi Web UI).
Go to Host â†’ Manage â†’ Hardware â†’ PCI Devices.
Find your USB controller and enable "Passthrough".
Reboot the ESXi host.

Step 2: Add the USB HDD to Security Onion VM
Power off your Security Onion VM.
Open ESXi Web UI.
Go to VM Settings â†’ Add New Device â†’ USB Controller.
Select the USB device (your HDD).
Save and power on the Security Onion VM.

Step 3: Mount USB HDD in Security Onion
SSH into Security Onion:
ssh username@securityonion_IP

Check if the USB drive is detected:
lsblk
Your HDD should appear as something like /dev/sdb or /dev/sdc.

Create a mount point:
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/pcaps
Mount the drive (assuming it's /dev/sdb1):

sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/pcaps
Make the mount permanent:

Edit fstab:
sudo nano /etc/fstab
Add this line:
/dev/sdb1 /mnt/pcaps ext4 defaults,nofail 0 2
Save (Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter).

Step 4: Change Security Onion to Store PCAPs on USB HDD
Move existing PCAPs:
sudo mv /nsm/pcaps/* /mnt/pcaps/

Update Security Onion configuration:
sudo nano /etc/securityonion.conf

Find the PCAP storage path and update it:
PCAP_PATH=/mnt/pcaps

Save changes and restart Security Onion services:
sudo so-restart
âœ… Now, PCAPs will be saved directly to the USB HDD! This eliminates the need for SCP and large daily transfers.

Option 2: Attach the USB HDD Directly to the ESXi Host (More Complex)
Instead of passing the USB drive to the VM, you could:

Mount the USB drive on ESXi itself.
Create an NFS or iSCSI share on ESXi.
Mount this network storage inside Security Onion.
However, this is more complex and USB storage on ESXi is not officially supported, so I donâ€™t recommend this unless absolutely necessary.

Which Option is Better?
âœ… Best Option â†’ USB Passthrough + Direct Mount in Security Onion (Option 1)

Pros: Simple, no network transfer needed, PCAPs stored directly.
Cons: Needs ESXi reboot to enable passthrough.
ðŸš« Not Recommended â†’ Mounting USB HDD on ESXi (Option 2)

Cons: ESXi doesnâ€™t officially support USB storage well.
Final Recommendation
If USB passthrough works, this is the best way to avoid SCP/rsync headaches. Let me know if you need help with the setup! ðŸš€
