Super Detailed Tutorial: Configuring Steps 2 and 3 on an ESXi Host

This guide will walk you through configuring the Management Network (VMkernel NIC) and the virtual switch (vSwitch) on your ESXi host step-by-step. I’ve written it assuming you’re new to this, so it’s broken down carefully.

Step 2: Configure the Management Network on an ESXi Host

1. Log In to the ESXi Host
	1.	Open a web browser.
	2.	Enter the IP address of your ESXi host (e.g., https://192.168.50.10).
	3.	Log in with your root username and password.

2. Check the Current Management Network Configuration
	1.	Once logged in, go to the left-hand menu and click Networking.
	2.	Click on the VMkernel NICs tab at the top.
	3.	Look for an existing VMkernel NIC:
	•	Interface Name: Typically vmk0 (default for Management Network).
	•	IP Address: It should show the IP address you assigned during installation (e.g., 192.168.50.10).
	•	Port Group: Should say Management Network.

3. Edit the Management Network VLAN

If the VLAN ID is not set, you’ll need to add it to ensure traffic is tagged correctly.
	1.	In the VMkernel NICs tab:
	•	Look for vmk0.
	•	Check its Port Group (it should be Management Network).
	2.	Click the Port Groups tab at the top.
	3.	Find the Management Network port group.
	4.	Click on it, then select Actions > Edit Settings.
	5.	In the settings window:
	•	Look for the VLAN ID field.
	•	Enter 50 (this ensures traffic is tagged with VLAN 50).
	6.	Click Save.

4. Verify the IP Address and VLAN
	1.	Return to the VMkernel NICs tab.
	2.	Ensure the following:
	•	IP Address: Correct (e.g., 192.168.50.x).
	•	VLAN ID: Displays 50 under the associated Port Group.
	3.	If the IP is wrong, you can fix it:
	•	Click on vmk0.
	•	Select Actions > Edit Settings.
	•	Update the IPv4 Address (e.g., 192.168.50.10 for this host).
	•	Ensure the subnet mask (e.g., 255.255.255.0) and gateway (e.g., 192.168.50.1) are correct.
	•	Save the settings.

Step 3: Configure the Virtual Switch (vSwitch)

1. Open the Virtual Switches Tab
	1.	In the Networking section, click on the Virtual Switches tab.
	2.	Look for the default switch, vSwitch0.

2. Verify Physical Uplinks
	1.	Click on vSwitch0 to view its details.
	2.	Under the Uplink Ports section:
	•	Ensure at least one physical NIC is assigned (e.g., vmnic0).
	•	The Active Uplink should say vmnic0 or another NIC.
	3.	If no uplinks are assigned:
	•	Click Edit Settings for vSwitch0.
	•	Add an available physical NIC (e.g., vmnic0) as an Active Uplink.
	•	Click Save.

3. Verify Port Group Settings
	1.	Return to the Port Groups tab.
	2.	Ensure the Management Network port group is associated with vSwitch0.
	3.	If it’s not, edit the port group and move it to vSwitch0.

4. Confirm and Save
	1.	Go back to VMkernel NICs to confirm:
	•	The Management Network is on vSwitch0.
	•	The VLAN ID is correctly set to 50.
	•	The physical NIC uplink is active.

What’s Next?

After completing this for one host:
	•	Test connectivity by pinging it from your computer.
	•	Repeat these steps on all ESXi hosts.

Absolutely! If vCenter Server Appliance (VCSA) will be hosted as a VM on one of your ESXi hosts, the deployment process requires slightly adjusted steps. Here’s the updated tutorial:

Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure:
	1.	ESXi Host Accessibility:
	•	One of your ESXi hosts is prepared to host the vCenter VM.
	•	It has sufficient CPU, memory, and storage for your chosen VCSA deployment size.
	•	The host is accessible via its management IP (e.g., https://192.168.50.10).
	2.	DNS Configuration:
	•	On your DC (hosting DNS), create an A record for the vCenter FQDN (e.g., vcenter.domain.local) pointing to the static IP you’ll assign during deployment.
	•	Add a PTR record for reverse DNS.
	3.	NTP Configuration:
	•	Verify that the DC is running as an NTP server and accessible from the ESXi host.
	4.	Static IP for vCenter:
	•	Reserve a static IP for vCenter Server.
	5.	VCSA ISO:
	•	Download the vCenter Server Appliance ISO from VMware’s website and mount it on your workstation.

Step 1: Deploy the VCSA Appliance

1. Mount the ISO on Your Workstation
	•	Mount the downloaded VCSA ISO on your local machine.

2. Launch the Installer
	•	Navigate to the ISO contents and run the installer:
	•	For Windows: vcsa-ui-installer.exe.
	•	For macOS/Linux: Use the appropriate binary in the installer folder.

3. Choose Deployment Type
	•	Select Install to start a new vCenter Server deployment.

4. Connect to the Target ESXi Host
	•	In the Stage 1: Deploy Appliance wizard:
	1.	Target ESXi Host:
	•	Enter the management IP or FQDN of the ESXi host where the vCenter VM will reside.
	•	Provide the ESXi host’s root username and password.
	2.	Accept any certificate warnings.

5. Configure the Appliance
	1.	Select Deployment Type:
	•	Choose Embedded PSC (Platform Services Controller).
	•	This is the default and simplest configuration for most setups.
	2.	Set Appliance Details:
	•	VM Name: Provide a name for the vCenter VM (e.g., vCenter).
	•	Root Password: Set the root password for the appliance.
	3.	Select Deployment Size:
	•	Choose the appropriate size based on your environment:
	•	Tiny: Up to 10 hosts and 100 VMs.
	•	Small: Up to 100 hosts and 1,000 VMs.
	4.	Select Datastore:
	•	Choose a datastore on the target ESXi host where the VCSA VM will be deployed.
	•	Enable thin provisioning if you want to save storage space.
	5.	Network Configuration:
	•	Port Group: Choose the Management Network port group (VLAN 50).
	•	Static IP: Assign the vCenter VM’s static IP (e.g., 192.168.50.100).
	•	Subnet Mask/Gateway: Match your network configuration.
	•	FQDN: Enter the vCenter Server’s fully qualified domain name (e.g., vcenter.domain.local).

6. Deploy the Appliance
	•	Review the settings and click Finish to start the deployment.
	•	The appliance VM will be created and deployed on the ESXi host.

Step 2: Configure the VCSA Appliance

1. Begin Stage 2
	•	Once Stage 1 is complete, the installer will prompt you to start Stage 2.
	•	Click Continue to proceed with configuration.

2. Setup Configuration
	1.	NTP Configuration:
	•	Select NTP and enter the IP or FQDN of your DC as the NTP server.
	•	Test the connection to ensure time synchronization.
	2.	SSO Domain:
	•	Create a new SSO domain (e.g., vsphere.local).
	•	Set the SSO administrator password.
	3.	Telemetry:
	•	Choose whether to join VMware’s Customer Experience Improvement Program (CEIP).
	4.	Finalize Configuration:
	•	Review the settings and click Finish.
	•	The appliance will configure itself and reboot.

Step 3: Access the vCenter Server
	1.	Open a browser and navigate to:
	•	https://<vcenter-FQDN> (e.g., https://vcenter.domain.local).
	2.	Log in with:
	•	Username: administrator@vsphere.local.
	•	Password: The SSO admin password you set during Stage 2.

Step 4: Add ESXi Hosts to vCenter
	1.	In the vCenter web client:
	•	Navigate to Hosts and Clusters.
	•	Right-click your Datacenter or create a new one.
	2.	Add your ESXi hosts:
	•	Select Add Host.
	•	Enter the FQDN or IP of the ESXi host.
	•	Provide the root credentials for the ESXi host.
	•	Repeat for all your hosts.

Step 5: Finalize Networking
	1.	Verify VMkernel Connectivity:
	•	Ensure all ESXi hosts can communicate via the Management Network.
	2.	(Optional) Set Up a Distributed Switch:
	•	If managing networking across all hosts centrally, create a Distributed Virtual Switch.
	3.	Test Features:
	•	Test basic features like vMotion or HA (if configured).

Tips for Success
	•	Verify DNS Resolution:
	•	Ensure your vCenter FQDN and ESXi FQDNs resolve correctly from all devices.
	•	Backup Plan:
	•	Once deployed, configure backup for your vCenter Server.
	•	NTP Sync:
	•	Confirm time synchronization across all devices.
