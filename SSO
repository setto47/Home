Setting up Single Sign-On (SSO) with Splunk using SAML and ADFS involves several steps. You’re correct that SAML is required for SSO functionality, as LDAP alone doesn’t support SSO. Here’s a detailed guide to configure SSO in your environment:

1. Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following:
	•	ADFS is installed and configured on your domain controller.
	•	Splunk is already installed and running on your server.
	•	You have admin access to Splunk and ADFS.
	•	An SSL certificate is installed and configured for ADFS (SAML requires HTTPS).

2. Configure ADFS as a SAML Identity Provider (IdP)
	1.	Create a Relying Party Trust in ADFS:
	•	Open ADFS Management Console.
	•	Navigate to Trust Relationships > Relying Party Trusts and select Add Relying Party Trust.
	•	Use the Add Relying Party Trust Wizard:
	•	Select Claims aware.
	•	Enter Splunk’s SAML endpoint as the relying party trust identifier. This is usually:

https://<splunk-server>:<port>/saml/acs

Replace <splunk-server> with your Splunk server’s hostname or IP and <port> with the Splunk web port (default is 8000).

	•	Configure identifiers and endpoints as needed, then save the trust.

	2.	Configure Claim Rules for Splunk:
	•	After creating the relying party trust, configure claim rules:
	•	Rule 1: Send LDAP Attributes as Claims
	•	Claim Rule Name: Send LDAP Attributes
	•	Attribute Store: Active Directory
	•	Map LDAP attributes to outgoing claim types. For example:
	•	E-Mail-Addresses → `Name ID



Got it! Let’s walk through configuring ADFS from scratch so you can use it as your SAML Identity Provider (IdP) for SSO with Splunk. Follow these steps:

1. Install ADFS
	1.	Add the ADFS Role:
	•	Open Server Manager on your domain controller or another Windows Server.
	•	Go to Manage > Add Roles and Features.
	•	Select Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS).
	•	Follow the wizard and install the role.
	2.	Install SSL Certificate:
	•	ADFS requires HTTPS to work with SAML.
	•	Obtain an SSL certificate (from a trusted CA or self-signed for testing).
	•	Bind the SSL certificate to the default website in IIS on the ADFS server:
	•	Open IIS Manager.
	•	Go to Sites > Default Web Site > Bindings.
	•	Add or edit the HTTPS binding and assign the certificate.

2. Configure ADFS
	1.	Run the ADFS Configuration Wizard:
	•	After installing ADFS, open the ADFS Management console.
	•	Select Configure the Federation Service on this server.
	•	Follow the wizard:
	•	Choose Create the first federation server in a federation server farm.
	•	Select your SSL certificate.
	•	Set the Federation Service Name (e.g., fs.yourdomain.com).
	•	Complete the wizard and restart the server if prompted.
	2.	Verify ADFS Installation:
	•	Open a browser and navigate to:

https://<adfs-server>/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon.htm


	•	Replace <adfs-server> with your ADFS server’s hostname.
	•	If the page loads, ADFS is set up correctly.

3. Add Splunk as a Relying Party Trust
	1.	Create the Relying Party Trust:
	•	Open the ADFS Management console.
	•	Go to Trust Relationships > Relying Party Trusts and click Add Relying Party Trust.
	•	Use the wizard to configure the trust:
	•	Select Claims aware.
	•	For the Federation Metadata URL, Splunk doesn’t generate this automatically. Use the manual configuration option and enter the following:
	•	Relying Party Identifier:

https://<splunk-server>:<port>/saml/acs

Replace <splunk-server> and <port> with your Splunk details.

	•	SAML Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL: Same as above.

	2.	Set Claims Rules:
	•	After creating the trust, configure the claims rules for user authentication:
	•	Rule 1: Send LDAP Attributes as Claims
	•	Map LDAP attributes to outgoing claims:
	•	E-Mail-Addresses → Name ID
	•	User-Principal-Name → Name ID

4. Configure Splunk for SAML
	1.	Enable SAML in Splunk:
	•	Log into Splunk as an admin.
	•	Navigate to Settings > Authentication Methods > SAML Authentication.
	•	Configure the SAML settings:
	•	Single Sign-On URL:

https://<adfs-server>/adfs/ls/


	•	Entity ID:

https://<splunk-server>:<port>/saml/metadata


	•	IdP Certificate: Export the token-signing certificate from ADFS and upload it here.
	•	Attribute Mapping: Map SAML attributes to Splunk roles (e.g., email or UPN).

	2.	Restart Splunk:
	•	Restart Splunk to apply the changes.

5. Test SSO
	•	Open a browser and navigate to your Splunk instance.
	•	If everything is configured correctly, you’ll be redirected to the ADFS login page (or automatically logged in if using Windows Integrated Authentication).

Yes, you can use a self-signed SSL certificate for your local environment, especially if it’s strictly internal and doesn’t need public internet access. However, keep in mind a few important points about self-signed certificates:

Advantages of a Self-Signed Certificate
	1.	No Cost: You don’t need to purchase a certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
	2.	Sufficient for Local Environments: Self-signed certificates are adequate for internal systems where you control the client devices.

Steps to Create and Use a Self-Signed Certificate
	1.	Generate the Certificate:
	•	Open PowerShell on your ADFS server as an administrator.
	•	Run the following command to create a self-signed certificate:

New-SelfSignedCertificate -DnsName "fs.yourdomain.com" -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\LocalMachine\My"

Replace fs.yourdomain.com with the Federation Service Name you are using.

	2.	Export the Certificate:
	•	Open the Certificates MMC:
	•	Run mmc in the Run dialog (Win + R).
	•	Add the Certificates snap-in for the Local Computer.
	•	Navigate to Personal > Certificates.
	•	Locate the self-signed certificate you just created.
	•	Right-click the certificate, select Export, and export it as a .pfx file (with the private key) for use with ADFS.
	3.	Bind the Certificate to ADFS:
	•	During ADFS setup, select this self-signed certificate when prompted to configure SSL.
	4.	Install the Certificate on Client Machines:
	•	Because it’s self-signed, it won’t be trusted by client machines by default.
	•	Distribute the self-signed certificate to all client machines and install it in the Trusted Root Certification Authorities store to prevent SSL warnings.

Considerations
	•	SSL Warnings: Without installing the certificate on clients, users will encounter SSL warnings in their browsers.
	•	Internal Use Only: This is safe for local networks but not recommended for external access.
	•	Future Scalability: If your setup grows or needs to be accessed externally, consider moving to a certificate from a trusted CA.

Using a self-signed certificate is completely fine in your local scenario as long as you account for the trust issue on client devices. Let me know if you’d like help with any specific part of this process!

No, you should not make your federation service name the same as your domain name. It is recommended to use a subdomain of your domain instead. For example:
	•	Domain Name: yourdomain.com
	•	Federation Service Name: fs.yourdomain.com (or something similar, like adfs.yourdomain.com)

Reasons for Using a Subdomain
	1.	Avoid Conflicts: If you make your federation service name the same as your domain name (e.g., yourdomain.com), it may cause DNS and routing conflicts, especially for other services (e.g., email, websites).
	2.	Clear Identification: Using a unique subdomain like fs.yourdomain.com or adfs.yourdomain.com helps distinguish the ADFS service from other services in your environment.
	3.	SSL Certificate Compatibility: SSL certificates for ADFS are specific to the federation service name. Using a subdomain ensures the certificate is correctly scoped to ADFS and avoids conflicts with certificates for other services.
	4.	Best Practice: It’s standard practice to use a dedicated subdomain for ADFS, which makes troubleshooting and maintenance easier.

Steps to Set the Federation Service Name
	1.	During ADFS setup, you will be prompted to specify the Federation Service Name.
	2.	Enter a subdomain of your domain (e.g., fs.yourdomain.com).
	3.	Ensure the subdomain resolves to your ADFS server:
	•	Add a DNS entry (A or CNAME record) in your DNS server to point fs.yourdomain.com to the IP address of your ADFS server.
